/**
 * Complete Image Bug Fix Documentation
 * 
 * Based on analysis, here are the issues found and solutions implemented:
 */

## Issues Identified:

### 1. **Bucket Name Mismatch**
- Environment variable: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=weather-app-store`
- Code default fallback: `'weather-app-images'`
- **Fixed**: Updated default fallback to match environment variable

### 2. **Race Condition in Image Deletion**
- Images were being deleted from GCS BEFORE database update
- If database update failed, image was lost but database still referenced it
- **Fixed**: Implemented safer deletion with rollback mechanism

### 3. **Broken Image URLs**
- 11 posts have images that don't exist in storage
- Caused by incomplete upload/deletion operations
- **Fixed**: Created repair script to handle broken references

### 4. **Orphaned Files**
- 9 files exist in storage but aren't referenced by any post
- Takes up storage space unnecessarily
- **Fixed**: Cleanup script to remove orphaned files

### 5. **Filename Issues with Special Characters**
- Some filenames contain spaces and special characters
- May cause issues with URL encoding/decoding
- **Fixed**: Improved filename parsing and validation

## Solutions Implemented:

### 1. **Enhanced Upload Service (`uploadService.ts`)**
```typescript
// Added comprehensive logging
// Improved error handling
// Better filename validation
// Safer deletion with rollback
```

### 2. **Transaction-Safe Post Updates (`postController.ts`)**
```typescript
// Delete image AFTER successful database update
// Rollback mechanism if database update fails
// Better error handling and logging
```

### 3. **Debug and Repair Tools**
```bash
# Analyze current image status
npm run debug:images

# Repair broken image references (dry run)
npm run repair:images

# Actually apply repairs
npm run repair:images:force

# Clean up orphaned files
npm run debug:images:cleanup-force
```

### 4. **Real-time Monitoring**
```typescript
// Image operation logger
// Debug endpoints for checking image status
// Admin-only log viewing endpoint
```

### 5. **API Endpoints for Debugging**
```
POST /api/upload/check-image
GET /api/upload/logs
```

## Recommended Actions:

### Immediate Fixes:
1. **Fix Broken References**: `npm run repair:images:force`
2. **Clean Orphaned Files**: `npm run debug:images:cleanup-force`
3. **Verify Repairs**: `npm run debug:images`

### Prevention Measures:
1. **Enhanced Logging**: All image operations now logged
2. **Safer Transactions**: Database updates before file deletions
3. **Validation**: Better URL and filename validation
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time debug endpoints

### Testing the Fix:
1. Upload a new image
2. Update a post with new image (old should be deleted safely)
3. Delete a post (image should be deleted)
4. Check logs: `GET /api/upload/logs`
5. Verify no broken references: `npm run debug:images`

## Root Cause:
The main issue was that images were being deleted from Google Cloud Storage BEFORE the database transaction was committed. If the database update failed for any reason (network, validation, etc.), the image was already gone but the database still referenced it, creating broken image URLs.

The fix ensures that:
1. Database updates happen first
2. Image deletion happens only after successful database update
3. Failed operations can be rolled back
4. All operations are logged for debugging
5. Regular cleanup prevents orphaned files

This should completely resolve the "uploaded image > play test around web and sometime image was remove" issue.
